# Autonomys Improvement Proposal (AIP) Process

The Autonomys Improvement Proposal (AIP) process is designed to foster collaboration and innovation within the Autonomys Network community. It provides a structured way for contributors to propose changes, enhancements, or new features for the network. By engaging the community and utilizing the Substrate governance pallet, AIPs ensure transparency, inclusivity, and consensus-driven decision-making.

## 1. **Purpose of an AIP**

An AIP is a formal mechanism to:

- Propose new features or technical enhancements.
- Suggest protocol changes or network upgrades.
- Introduce process improvements or governance adjustments.

All stakeholders, including developers, farmers, and community members, are encouraged to participate in the AIP process.

## 2. **Lifecycle of an AIP**

### Step 1: **Raise a Forum Post**

The process begins with an informal discussion on the [Autonomys Forum](https://forum.autonomys.xyz) to gauge interest and solicit feedback.

- **Post Requirements:**
    - A clear and concise title (e.g., "AIP-1: Proposal to Increase Block Rewards").
    - A summary of the idea or change.
    - Rationale for the proposal and its potential benefits.
    - Considerations or challenges, if applicable.
    - Open questions for community feedback.
- **Discussion Goals:**
    - Identify potential improvements or concerns.
    - Gather support or suggestions for refinement.
- **Tagging:** Use the tag `AIP` to categorize the post.

### Step 2: **Draft a Formal AIP**

Based on forum discussions, create a formal AIP document. The AIP should follow a standardized template to ensure clarity and consistency. Once ready for submission, a pull request with the formal AIP should be raised in the Subspace Foundation [improvement-proposals](https://github.com/subspace/improvement-proposals) GitHub repository.

### AIP Template:

```markdown
# AIP-[Number]: [Proposal Title]

## Author(s)
[Name or pseudonym]

## Status
Draft

## Created
[Date]

## Summary
A brief explanation of the proposal.

## Motivation
Why this proposal is necessary and the problem it aims to solve.

## Specification
Details of the technical or process changes proposed.

## Rationale
Explanation of how the proposal benefits the network and its participants.

## Risks and Considerations
Potential drawbacks or challenges.

## Implementation Plan
Steps required to implement the change, including technical details and timelines.

## References
Links to relevant discussions, documents, or research.

### Step 3: **Implementation and Monitoring**

- **Execution:** Once approved, the changes outlined in the AIP will be implemented, either by developers or other relevant stakeholders.
- **Follow-up:** Monitor the impact of the proposal and address any unforeseen issues.

---

### Step 4: **Submit the Proposal for Governance**

Once the AIP draft is finalized and has community support, it should be submitted to the Autonomys on-chain governance system using the Substrate governance pallet.

- **Process:**
    - **Preliminary Steps:** Proposers may need to bond tokens to initiate a proposal on-chain.
    - **Submission:** Submit the AIP as an on-chain proposal.
    - **Community Voting:** The proposal will undergo a voting period during which token holders can cast their votes.
    - **Outcome:** If the proposal passes, it will proceed to implementation.

**NOTE**: While the network is bootstrapping, the initial on-chain governance voting implementation is permissioned to the foundation council members. This restriction will be removed as the Subspace Foundation executes on its plan for progressive decentralization.

## 3. **Proposal Statuses**

An AIP will progress through the following statuses:

1. **Draft:** Initial stage; under discussion on the forum.
2. **Finalized:** Ready for submission on-chain.
3. **Voting:** Under consideration by the governance system.
4. **Approved:** Passed governance and ready for implementation.
5. **Rejected:** Did not pass governance.
6. **Implemented:** Successfully executed.

## 4. **Guidelines for Contributors**

- Be clear and concise.
- Focus on the benefits to the network and community.
- Be open to feedback and collaboration.
- Adhere to the AIP template for formal submissions.
